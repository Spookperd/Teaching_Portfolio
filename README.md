# Teaching Notes:
This notebook is based on the idea that a student should be able to:
- Understand the fundamental way a model works.
- Understand when a model is applicable, and what it's limitations are.
- Understand how to code a model, including the use of it's parameters.
- Evaluate the quality of the model's predictions.
- Interpret any insights a model has.
    
Very often, students fail the last step. While an accurate model is valuable, an interpretable model guides a business to make better decisions.
  
An exersize was also included in the same notebook where students have to esentially fill in the blanks, but also interpret the output of a model. This would likely be better in a separate notebook.  
    
This notebook is a MVP and with contribution from the team and continuous feedback from students, the concepts can be refined.
